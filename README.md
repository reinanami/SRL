# Supervised-Reinforcement Learning Framework
Used for test purposes via Python!

#Fixes needed:
#STAGE 1
Accuracy and fixing
- ORGANIZE!!! Example...Globally defining nObservations and nActions
- Ensuring accuracy by thoroughly comparing against the documentation: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html
- Adding enough comments so everyone can equally understand
- Ensure that this works by asking a trusted expert
- Make sure algorithms don't consume so much power that the potential Raspberry Pi microcontroller bakes (in Gen Z terms, cooked)
#STAGE 2
Testing
- Am not sure where to get training data from but ideally something related to aviation
- Make sure that it can independently receive inputs via pretend-microcontrollers in real-time
STAGE 3: Hardware flashing
- We must decide if it's best to convert this int C/C++ before flashing onto hardware
- Research how we're sensing the surroundings
